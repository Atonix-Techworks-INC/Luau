# Luau Decompiler

I wrote this over the span of 2-3 days, and as of right now it ONLY produces disassembly output (psuedo-decompilation), so it's not entirely a decompiler yet.

Credits are much appreciated, though I don't include them in the script.
I ONLY require that you don't claim originality, or say that it was written by yourself.

Before I move onto scope/flow control, it's important that I make a disassembler that is fully capable first, supporting all opcodes, with full readability, so that even if the decompiler does not produce the expected output, there will be an option for disassembly. Because, decompilers will always be far from perfect and should never be expected to produce perfect output.

This script produces 2 local functions, disassemble and decompile.
As of right now, decompile is set to disassemble.

Enjoy, this is a free/public project for use in any executor.
(my decompiler will remain private for some time)
